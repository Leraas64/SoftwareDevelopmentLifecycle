#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Throughout this class I have learned that creating user stories can help a coder understand what the client wants added into a program. This works because there is a basic structure of "client wants this." This way every story has a clearly defined type of person and a feature they want added into the program. This means less translating for the coder and a quicker coding session.

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
After this class, I enjoy the Agile approach as it allows the team to start with basic code and allow possible edits throughout. This helps to create less of a hassle later if a certain plan was followed and then changed along the way. I will try to incorporate this method in my coding by writing the base code first and fine tuning it as I write other code.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means that you play your part and work together with your team to create a product. It is important to work together, especially when creating code for a larger project.
